How to measure efficacy of curriculum?
	AG research is Qualitative.
	Interview, exit test, workshop, group
	Determine how students spend time outside of lab space

How to relate to unloved subjects:
	phenomenon and model based inquiry
		based new info on puzzles/phenom
		Start with puzzle, work backwards to laws
		More demanding on both student and teacher

Teaching Techniques?
	TA active role: asking strategic questions
			Discourse moves
			STudents learn best by talking about SCience
				Not just in pairs, but class
			Create conversations, elicit conversation
			Allow students to sandbox their responses
	Avoid having teachers "fish" for correct answers
	All students should share in meaningful way

How to teach teachers/TAs? (improve teachers)
	Possible teaching session with Dr. Gonzales

Partners: assigned random, assigned by gender, students decide etc?
	NOT by GPA; randomly might be best
	Groups of 4, or 2x2 are best

2-Part Labs: protocol vs student led vs mix
	Mix is probably very good; written protocol probably isn't
		Either way, discussion is needed between students

Gender impact, avoid gender bias?
	Try to be aware of "silencing" effects

Feedback on redesigning labs?

Notes:
	Tomlinson teaching workshop: ambitious science teaching 			strategies



----------------------------------------------------------------------
Teaching techniques:
	- Avoid general bias environment
	- Science understanding comes from discussion
	- Ask "leading" questions to illicit understanding
	- "Sandbox" environment to promote discussions
		- Confortable environment for equal discussion
	- Ask questions to "get right answer" should be avoided: it's
		about HOW to get the right answer, rather than the
		answer itself

TA training:
	- A must!
	- Active learning techniques from TA's

Partners: Random

How to measure efficiency: surveys

How to connect with students:
	- Phenomonon based inquiry:
		- Present phenomonon BEFORE theory
		- forces them to think of the actual physical phenomonon before going into details
		- But probably more demanding for students
