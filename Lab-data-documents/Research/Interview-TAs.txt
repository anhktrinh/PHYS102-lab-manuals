Equipment:
	Impact? Need for replacement/simplification.
	- Doesn't matter.
	Matei: Yes; but to what extant is uncertain
	Rob: Consideration for first-time things, like using an oscilloscope
	Scott: Agreed

Partners:
	Assigned vs random etc
	- Better to choose their own.
	Matei: Better to choose, +/- small error
	Rob: Let them choose
	Scott: Agreed

Emphasis:
	Do current labs emphasize stats/phys/math/etc?
	- Phys then Hands-on.
	Matei: 80/20 phys/hands-on
	Rob: Should be hand-on, ignore uncertainty and error
	Scott: Students get fixated on details (sig figs); phrasing the questions to high-light
		Some physics, need coralling; one principal per lab; lectures should be in phase
	- Prereading test (already in 102, not 101)
	Rob: (N/A); extra work isn't necessarily worthwhile
	Scott: Unsure if they are effective; occasional quiz was effective
	- Better to have 2-session; (perhaps more stressful?)
	Matei: Learning clash, difficult to implement
	Scott: Like the idea, unsure if they are qualified (what if I do this?)
	Rob: Agreed

Workload:
	Workload distribution: graders vs demonstrators
	- Seperated (maybe 40 up to 70-90)
	Rob: Markers seperate much better for TAs
	Matei: Diffcult to say, benefits on both sides
	Scott and Rob: Not at 90, but rather not work 90
	Could you afford to do more work?
	- Maybe, maybe not, but more TAs would be best
	Matei: Technically fair, but difficult to push
	
BioPhys:
	Add examples/materials for bio students to make material more relateable?
	- Quite beneficial, where possible
	Matei: Maybe, but preferentially favours Bio (only as examples)
	Rob: Maybe in lecture or supplementary materials
	Scott: Leave uncluttered, TAs would need to learn the material themselves

Notes:
Quality TA matters more than students.
	Matei: more training is better
	Rob: Better experience
	Scott: A lot! A good demo, experienced TAs can be effective; less shy TAs
Better TA training, mandatory experimental experience
	Matei: Signing in mandetory
	Rob: Need 'teacher voice' and better writing, seeking students out
		Force TAs to demo to each other
	Scott: Perhaps
Prepare instructions ahead of time
Practice and mentorship
	Matei: Mentorship is good, but difficult to implement
	Rob: 
	Scott: 

Matei:
TA complaints:
	List exists
	Crowdmark sucks.
	Avoid groups of labs
	Different equipment from manual
Student complaints:
	TAs misleading them
Errata:
	Always try to do it, but nobody seems to actually do it.
Rubric:
	Graders come with rubric
Notes:
	More transparent (non-anonymous) reviews.
