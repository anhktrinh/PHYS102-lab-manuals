Cornell lab drafts.zip contains the Mechanics labs we’ve been using (always a work in progress). 
They hopefully give you an idea of how we structure things. The Pendulum rubric doc shows you one of 
the rubrics for our Pendulum for Pros lab. And the “Training” doc shows you the handout we give to TAs 
during our prep meeting. 

The Holmes et al. 2013 paper is the TA development paper with the broken link online. 

E-Class survey:

Physics Lab Inventory of Critical thinking (PLIC), is a closed-response assessment of student critical 
thinking skills in intro lab courses. I have a version of the survey available here that you can take 
a look at. This is our “expert” survey – it would be great for you to fill it out as expert physicists. 
We use the expert responses to compare to student performance.

Instructor survey:
If you are interested in using it in your courses, we have an Instructor Survey here. After filling 
out this survey, you will be emailed with a unique link to the pre survey, which can you send out 
to your students. The instructor survey includes questions about when you would like the pre and 
post survey open, as well as about the course you will use it with. We will send you the pre-test 
link within an hour of filling out the instructor survey, and the post-test link will arrive about 2 
weeks before the close date you request. Once the survey closes, you will be emailed a summary report 
with your students’ performance compared to other students who have taken the survey. (It’s the same 
process as the E-CLASS, if you’ve used it before).
