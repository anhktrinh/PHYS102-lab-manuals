Hi folks,

It was great to chat on Friday. Sounds like you’ve got some great ideas and I look forward to hearing how it goes.
Some info on assessment:

We’ve developed the Physics Lab Inventory of Critical thinking (PLIC) - a closed-response survey designed to 
assess how students critically evaluate experimental methods, data, and models. Average completion time is 
about 15 minutes and it’s all online via Qualtrics, so you can assign it for them to take at home (recommendation 
is to assign some amount of course credit to incentivize filling it out – doing it in class is easy if you can 
forego the time). 
 
You can take a look at the questions by completing our Expert Survey. Responses from experts like you help us 
validate the questions and our scoring, plus it gives you a chance to see what we’re asking students to do:

If you are interested in using it, (and when you are interested in using it) you can fill out our Instructor 
Survey: https://cornell.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5ouHoTGEF5FBqxD
 
Completing this survey will automatically generate links to a pre- and post-test survey unique for your class. 
At the end of the semester, we will generate a report that will be emailed to you, and provides a summary of 
your students’ performance, as well as comparisons to other courses similar to yours. The system also sends 
timely reminders throughout the semester. 
 
Other surveys that may be of interest to you are the Concise Data Processing Assessment (info here: 
https://www.physport.org/assessments/CDPA ) or the E-CLASS (https://www.physport.org/assessments/ECLASS ).
 
Cheers,
Natasha
