Work at UBC & Cornell:
	Testing models and limits; Data analysis

While there's no data on this, she thinks that having
a strong math background doesn't matter to attaining the
goal of good scientific thought process, but it does
limit the types of labs made possible

Since the final answer doesn't matter, it's more about
the path to get to an answer, so cheating prevention
methods can be revised (i.e. use of computer should
probably be allowed)

Additionally, the content doesn't matter as much, so
the challenge becomes about creating labs don't allow
for profound in-depth analysis. This leads to a
possibility that some students find the manipulations
and physics too easy although this, from the data,
is typically an "illusion of simplicity" where
the students actually didn't show in-depth analysis.

This methodology does increase correction time

While the litterature is inconclusive about the
matter, embedding the labs in a familiar context
for the audience can probably help

It may be a good idea to verify the students other
classes to be sure there isn't an overlap, but 
presenting this methodology gives students an
overview of physics research and in general,
physics is a more quantifiable science than
the others, so this is a proper place to teach
this type of content.

See email for types of test to quantify the
efficiency of these types of labs
