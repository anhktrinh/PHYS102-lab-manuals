Grading rubric:
20% Pre-lab
50% Journal
10% Attendance
20% Participation

Most grading is done outside of class
Experimented with grading through interviews: seems to work
Evaluation is by thought process, not so much result
	Emphasize how to \textit{test} their hypothesis as opposed to
	just stating what they think

"Change" format to have \textit{discusion} period at the end with everyone
as opposed to have them discuss pairwise


She has data to support assessment of the new format


Capacitance lab feedback
Good thing that C vs r has log dependence so that students can discuss it


Magnetism lab: Lenz's law
	Dropping magnet through coils
