# PHYS102-lab-manuals

This folder contains only the TA lab manual.

Unless I need to perform small changes to both documents, I usually work on the TA Lab manual first.
Once I've completed the necessary changes, I will copy-paste the entire TA lab mnaual latex code into
another tex file (and folder) to create the student lab manual, and remove manually the tcolorbox sections.
